                      engaging users through non-disruptive animations.

                      became a crucial necessity and also, The analysis of

                    The website had previously assigned a modal window to notify
                    customers who hadn’t subscribed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Initially, when I proposed the first ideas of modal windows
                    used in this project, there was concern about whether this
                    was too inhibited when had proposed the first ideas of modal
                    windows used in this project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, after considering various options, I decided to
                    incorporate static animations that could be used flexibly.
                    While creative implementation is essential and enjoyable, it
                    must also account for the limits and requirements of the
                    project, and balancing creative implementation with
                    limitations and requirements is essential, and I am always
                    dedicated to approaching this with empathy.

                    with visually compelling material to make it stand out
                    effectively.

                    Analyzing abandonment and bounce rates revealed an
                    inappropriate layout affecting user experience. Considering
                    the analysis, replacing organic text with icons and a
                    thoughtful redesign have clarified and addressed these
                    issues.

                      Resolved the prior issue of a cluttered and

                      I identified opportunities to integrate new functions,
                      providing additional avenues for product purchases. We’ve
                      been implementing a website function to help users
                      determine their skin type, a significant contributor to

                      Additionally, the Product Detail Page (PDP) features the
                      same function, although it was not initially optimized for
                      a seamless user experience tied to the purchase and
                      enhancement of increase rate. I have since made
                      adjustments to enhance its usability.

                      Apart from this project, I’ve been contemplating the use

                      potentially boost profitability. Recognizing the need for
                      a valid reason, I meticulously crafted this component for
                      proposing to the team as it could present another valuable
                      opportunity.

                      In the final decision, we opted to integrate a sticky CTA
                      that smoothly hides when it’s not in focus on essential
                      elements. Additionally, the CTA has been transformed into
                      a distinct section, enhancing the navigation of the eye
                      trajectory.

                      Product pages in any industry have the potential to be
                      both the first and last page a visitor interacts with.
                      Therefore, it is essential that these pages are designed
                      to independently meet and support the diverse needs of
                      customers.
