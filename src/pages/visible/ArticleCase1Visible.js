                      age. Finding products that work without a reaction to her
                      dry, reactive skin has been a difficult process – but
                      something she’s come to terms with, trying every product
                      in every price range. Since finding Riversol, she’s
                      narrowed down her routine, and has freed up storage space
                      in her bathroom because she no longer holds onto the
                      graveyard of skincare that didn’t work.

                      Allison is no stranger to the cliché of wanting to look
                      younger than she feels. She’s a relatively active and
                      healthy person – but just wishes the lines on her face and
                      neck never had to happen. Allison spent a lot of her
                      younger years sunbathing and is now looking to correct the
                      damage caused. Dark spots, lines, and general aging has
                      her feeling less confident than usual. Her best friend is
                      a breast cancer survivor who discovered Riversol through
                      necessity – the only products that would help her skin
                      after chemotherapy – and as soon as she told Allison about
                      the sampler, she had to try it. Since then, she’s been
                      hooked.

                      Effective design, when executed, seamlessly integrates

                      cases of poor design that its presence becomes noticeable.
                      Information architecture plays a crucial role in ensuring
                      a smooth and user-friendly experience.
