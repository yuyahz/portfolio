                  The intention of having a home page was certainly to make

                  One of the reasons he decided to create a site was because he

                  on the website. He already has his own blog, and it was also a
                  question of how his blog would appear on the website.

                  My first job when this project started was to guide the team
                  on the best path towards the goals of the project. Therefore,
                  I was responsible for building each section of the project,
                  designing it for different devices, managing the timeline,
                  giving detailed instructions to each developer, and overseeing
                  the whole process.

                  Design methods used during the project included journey
                  mapping, UI/UX design, and prototyping solutions. During the
                  project, I also designed features needed for a wider launch.

                  While some developers were inexperienced, it was a difficult
                  to proceed with the project in a limited time to convey the
                  first instruction with the design tool.

                <p>
                  In order to get a better understanding of the design, I
                  created it myself without using Adobe XD only at the
                  beginning.

                  The problem is that if we were able to communicate with the

                  think the project would have progressed a little faster.

                  At the beginning, I didn't plan to create blog content, but at
                  the time of the meeting, I received a request to create a blog
                  section, so I decided to do it in a hurry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At first, it was a key to create individual blog article pages
                  on the homepage, but since Larry wanted to make the system
                  simple to update and edit, end-users can touch the outline of
                  the article and assist clicking.
                </p>
                <p>I designed a UI that possible to do it.</p>

                <p>
                  The essential intention of this project is to make Larry's
                  experiences and books known to people all over the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not to let people know about their suffering, but to convey
                  their hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was convinced that at least my design would reach as many
                  people as possible.

                    It’s one thing to design a website: With so many online
                    resources available to guide you - both free and
                    subscription based - a website can be uploaded and be
                    functioning within hours. But, to have a website designed
                    that captures the wishes and personality of the client is
                    quite different. This presents a unique challenge. It takes
                    talent. It takes skill, and it takes patience. I was
                    fortunate to experience this with the students from
                    Cornerstone International Community College of Canada.
                    Cornerstone is a fully accredited college offering diploma
                    programs in Web & Mobile App Development, Network Solutions
                    & System Specialist, International Business Management,
                    Digital Marketing Specialist, Hospitality Management, and
                    Advertising and Graphic Design, as well as, English as
                    Second Language training. Their high-quality educational
                    services and career counselling are delivered within a
                    positive team environment. It serves Canadian and
                    international students from over 20 countries, and is
                    committed to assisting their students obtain gainful
                    employment in the shortest possible time. A team consisting
                    of final year students was assigned to assist me with the
                    design of a landing page and website to support a book
                    launch and my personal brand. The team comprised of: Ayaka
                    Tsubouchi Yuya Hashirizaki Anzu Nakayama Gabriel Sciacca
                    Dias Alexandre Bellini Dias Each team member was engaged and
                    fully invested in the project. Over a series of zoom calls,
                    questions were asked of me on what I was seeking to achieve.
                    The end product exceeded my expectations. Thanks to each
                    member of the team, the website captures my personality - it
                    has a soul! I would encourage any employer who may be
                    looking to hire engaged, creative and talented students to
                    look no further than Cornerstone, and these students.
